# fimoService
The meme suite's fimo (Find Individual Motif Occurences) as a microservice.


William Noble's lab at the University of Washington publishes the [MEME
Suite](http://meme-suite.org/index.html) - Motif-based sequence analysis tools.

We here provide R and python convenience functions for running
[FIMO](http://meme-suite.org/doc/fimo.html?man_type=web) on specified DNA sequence/s.

To demonstrate the FIMO serve, we use an example from the 2013 paper,
["Highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations in human melanoma"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423787),
which reports the creation of a transcript factor binding motif due to a single-base mutation.
